    text: "SNAPS prefabs are built to real-world scale but are designed to \u201Csnap\u201D
      together when used with ProGrids. \nGrid snap measurements start at 1m and are
      halved ( eg. 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 etc ) according to refinement needed to place
      or position smaller objects."

    text: Each SNAPS Pack caters for a particular theme and while they can be used
      together in a project, they are not designed to be "snap-able" between packs.
      Different themes require different size and scale settings.

    text: SNAPS packs are meant to be used in unison with ProBuilder and ProGrids,
      both available via the Package Manager. While the packs can be used without
      using ProGrids, ProBuilder will need to be installed.
